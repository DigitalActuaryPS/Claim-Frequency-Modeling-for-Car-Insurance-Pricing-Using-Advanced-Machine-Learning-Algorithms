This project demonstrates the application of various machine learning techniques to predict claims frequency for a large French motor third-party liability insurance portfolio. The dataset, sourced from the CAS datasets by Christophe Dutang, focuses on motor insurance policy data and claims frequency.

The aim is to leverage advanced machine learning techniques to enhance car insurance pricing strategies by accurately predicting claim frequencies. The project involves implementing and comparing traditional statistical methods with modern machine learning algorithms to find the most effective model for predicting claims.

Key Techniques and Models:
Generalized Linear Models (GLM):
GLM2: A basic GLM focusing on driver age and other key features.
GLM5: An advanced GLM incorporating interactions found using gradient tree boosting residual analyses.

Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM):
CatBoost: Efficiently handles categorical variables with robust performance.
Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR): Uses gradient boosting for regression tasks to compare performance against other models.

Methodology:
Data Preparation:
Merging frequency and severity datasets.
Correcting and clipping claim numbers and exposure values to ensure data integrity.
Handling missing values and preparing the data for modeling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyzing the distribution of key variables like claims per policy, exposures, and claim frequencies.
Visualizing modified claims frequency across different vehicle brands, ages, and fuel types.
Evaluating exposure and claim frequency by BonusMalus groups.

Model Implementation:
Training and evaluating GLM2 and GLM5 models.
Implementing and tuning CatBoost and GBR models to improve predictive performance.
Comparing models using Poisson Deviance and other evaluation metrics.

Feature Importance and SHAP Analysis:
Analyzing feature importance to understand the key drivers of claim frequency.
Using SHAP values to provide insights into how each feature contributes to the predictions.

Business Implications:
Risk Assessment: Enhanced predictive power for more accurate risk assessment and premium adjustment.
Pricing Strategy: Developing competitive and fair pricing strategies based on precise predictions.
Customer Segmentation: Effective customer segmentation to tailor marketing strategies and personalized product offerings.
Fraud Detection: Identifying patterns and anomalies to detect and prevent fraudulent claims.

Conclusion:
The project showcases the potential of advanced machine learning techniques, including GLM, CatBoost, and GBR, in improving car insurance pricing strategies. By integrating these advanced analytical tools, insurers can make more informed business decisions, leading to enhanced profitability and customer satisfaction. The insights derived from these models provide actionable intelligence for strategic initiatives, making this approach valuable for the insurance industry and beyond.
